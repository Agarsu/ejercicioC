Given 2 sequences of DNA of the SAME length (asked to the user with input())
    check that both have same length-yes
    	if not write an error an start again-yes
    transform them to RNA-yes
    make a reverse and reverse complementary-yes
    store in a dictionary all this data-yes

    sequences = {seq1:{seq:AC, rna:AC, seqrev:GC, seqrevcomp:CG, 
	prot:TS, protrecvomp:RR},
	seq2:{...}
    }

    Extra point: add a seq name in the dict. Hint, ask first for 
    seqname, then for the secuence letters, both with input() and 
    store in dict.
	-yes-

    pairwise comparison: Compare seq1 vs seq2 and find number of 
    differences and % of differences
	-yes-

    print message like: seq1 vs seq2 has 10 (10%) differences in 100pb
    	-yes-

    use the function get_codon_table (created in C for loading the 
    codons dictionary

    Note: for protein conversion, create a function to split DNA string	   in triplets and store in a list of triplets and ask the 
    codon_table_dictionary created in the C task

    triplets = get_triplets_from_sequence("atcgct...")

    print(triplets)

    ["atc","gct"...]

    loop for triplets and aa.append = codon_table[triplet]

    NOTE: remember to create a void list before the loop (aa = [])
